# Internship
During my internship at Southland Industries as an integration engineer, I created custom skills for Amazon Alexa.

This custom skill created a Trivia Game to integrate with a beer keg. 
You must answer the question correctly in order to unlock the keg and pour beer.

This is written in Node.js

Must download node.js and attach node modules in order to execute on Alexa. See the Amazon website for more details.
