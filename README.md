# Internship
During my internship at Southland Industries as an integration engineer, I created custom skills for Amazon Alexa.

This custom skill created a Trivia Game to integrate with a beer keg. 
You must answer the question correctly in order to unlock the keg and pour beer.

This is written in Node.js
