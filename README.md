# Internship
During my internship at Southland Industries as an integration engineer, I created custom skills for Amazon Alexa.

This custom skill created a Trivia Game to integrate with a beer keg. 
You must answer the question correctly in order to unlock the keg and pour beer.

This code is written in Node.js which is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications.

Must download node.js and attach node modules in order to execute with Alexa. See the Amazon website for more details.
